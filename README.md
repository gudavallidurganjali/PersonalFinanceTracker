# Personal Finance Tracker

Welcome to Personal Finance Tracker â€” a small starter UI/UX project with a React + Vite scaffold and a Figma-ready design spec.

Getting started (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

What I added:
- A minimal Vite + React scaffold (`package.json`, `index.html`, `src/`)
- UI components: `Header`, `Dashboard`, `ExpenseForm`
- A `designs/FIGMA_SPEC.md` containing a Figma design spec, color tokens, and component guidelines

Next steps:
- Run `npm install` locally and `npm run dev` to open the dev server.
- If you want, I can add Tailwind, authentication, persistent storage, or export ready Figma frames/screens.
